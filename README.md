# Gerrymandering Analysis using AI &  Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)

### **Authors:**  
**Abi Mengesha, Austin Asher, Jeremiah Brown**  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This project conducts a **thorough analysis of potential gerrymandering in Illinois's Senate and Presidential election districts** using the **GerryChain library**. The analysis involves generating **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations** to assess district fairness through various metrics like **cut edges, efficiency gaps, and mean-median differences**.

### ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement
This project investigates whether electoral district boundaries in Illinois are drawn to favor specific political outcomes by simulating thousands of alternate maps using MCMC. The goal is to analyze metrics like partisan bias, mean-median gap, and compactness to assess fairness.


The results of this project contribute to understanding **how the redrawing of district boundaries may disproportionately favor the Democratic party, potentially diluting minority voting power**.
