# Gerrymandering Analysis using AI &  Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)

### **Authors:**  
**Abi Mengesha, Austin Asher, Jeremiah Brown**  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This project conducts a **thorough analysis of potential gerrymandering in Illinois's Senate and Presidential election districts** using the **GerryChain library**. The analysis involves generating **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations** to assess district fairness through various metrics like **cut edges, efficiency gaps, and mean-median differences**.  

The results of this project contribute to understanding **how the redrawing of district boundaries may disproportionately favor the Democratic party, potentially diluting minority voting power**.

## ðŸ“Œ Features  
- âœ… **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations** for district analysis  
- âœ… **Data visualization of district boundaries & election outcomes**  
- âœ… **Statistical computing for large-scale electoral data**  
- âœ… **Automated analysis of district compactness & fairness**
